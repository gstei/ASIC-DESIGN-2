\subsection{Hardware}
In this section we introduce the hardware setup we created in order to validate our chip design and compare the samples we received with the results we expected from simulations. For a as like to like comparison with the simulation as possible we created hardware that replicates the virtual test bench setup as close as possible. Of particular interest to us are dynamic regulation characteristics of the buck-boost converter, as they give insight into the closed loop regulation characteristics like bandwidth and phase margin. In addition we want to test the functionality of the SPI interface as well as have the ability to measure internal signals such as the internal clock oscillator and the the bandgap reference voltage. \\
List of measurements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Line regulation
    \item Load regulation
    \item Output voltage regulation accuracy 
    \item Efficiency
    \item Startup behavior
    \item Short circuit behavior
    \item SPI functionality
    \item Clock frequency
    \item Bandgap reference voltage
\end{itemize}

Going further with the test bench analogy, we split the test setup into two components, a test bench like PCB with call the Adapter PCB and multiple smaller PCBs which contain the \ac{DUT} we refer to as Hats, as they are socketed onto the Adapter PCB.


\subsubsection{Adapter PCB}
The main Adapter PCB contains the functionality of the test bench and has a common plug-in location for the \ac{DUT} containing Hats. The Adapter is designed in such a way, that the \ac{DUT} can be placed in the thermal chamber of the thermal airstream system TP04300A in order to test the \ac{DUT} functionality under various thermal conditions. The PCB contains four electronically controllable loads for load step measurements and contains current sense amplifiers to measure the current flowing in and out of the switching converter on the \ac{DUT}. To test the SPI communication with the \ac{DUT} we have included an Arduino Every Nano which allows us to use easily create a program to read and write to registers on the \ac{DUT}.

\subsubsection{Hat PCB}
In total we created three Hat PCBs which can be used as \ac{DUT}s. One PCB contains a commercially available IC and we created two PCBs for our manufactured chip. In the first PCB our chip is socketed and in the second one the QFN package soldered directly to the board. The socketed version allows for the quick characterization of multiple chips and measurement of the variance of characteristics over the batch. The socket however introduces higher lead resistances and inductances as well as thermaly isolates the chip from the PCB. The thermal isolation could lead to increased temperatures in high load conditions and in the worst case could lead to damage of the chip. We do not expect these factors to play a major role for the characteristics we want to measure, but out of caution we decided to create a PCB with the chip directly soldered to the PCB. This allows us to verify our assumption and gives us a fallback, if our assumption turns out to be false and chip does not function correctly when socketed.\\

Our reasoning to create a Hat with a commercially available chip is two fold. First it allows us to validate our test setup with a real hardware \ac{DUT} before receiving samples of our chip and also creates a baseline to compare against. For the commercially available \ac{IC} we used the TPS63900 from Texas Instruments. While this \ac{IC} is significantly smaller in size, it has a similar input and voltage range as well as current drive capabilities. It is also a highly integrated buck-boost converter with integrated switches in the standard cascaded-buck-boost converter topology. The TPS63900 will however have a significantly higher efficiency, greater than \qty{90}{\percent},as it is designed for ultra low power applications and implements multiple advanced power saving features like dynamic switching frequency adjusting based on load conditions\cite{tps63900}. They additionally employ a novel drive scheme of the power stage leading to trapezoidal inductor current, as opposed to the traditional triangle waveform, which again leads to higher efficiency and a single operating mode over the entire input and output range\cite{tps63900}.
