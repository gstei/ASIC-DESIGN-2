\section{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclustion}

We were able to achieve our goal of designing a highly integrated buck-boost converter \ac{IC}, which meets the specifications given to us by the Sonova AG. The peak-current control based converter is able to accurately create a output voltage both higher and lower than its input. The output voltage can be maintained over the whole specified input voltage range and regulator can quickly react to changes on the input and output. To ensure save operation the design features a foldback over-current protection, which leads to a short circuit safe output and basic soft-start functionality. To protect the switching transistor from over-temperature induced failure, we implemented thermal shutdown mechanism, which safely shuts off the converter if the transistors get to hot. We were not able to meet the deadline for the the tape-out, as we had to change the converter topology late in the process and due to the significant time required in the layout stage of the design.\\\\
We faced a steep learning curve as both of us were unfamiliar we the tools as we started the project. Consequently, our initial timeline was to optimistic and had to be adjusted as the design and layout efforts required more time than anticipated. We sincerely appreciate the opportunity given to us by the university and department IMES to work on such an \ac{ASIC} project. However, we acknowledge the scope of the project was overly ambitious for a master's project, resulting in a significant higher time investment than anticipated.  Therefore, we recommend to our supervisor and expert that future projects should be smaller in scale, particularly if the participants are not proficient users of the design tools required, as a substantial amount of time was dedicated to learning the program and troubleshooting errors, rather than focusing on design aspects.\\\\
Having completed the pre-layout phase, we have successfully defined all the parameters necessary for measuring the ASIC. The system design simulation has indicated that the \ac{ASIC} should function as intended, giving us confidence that the final ASIC will work accordingly and we can proceed as planned.
