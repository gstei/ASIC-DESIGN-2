\section{Outlook}
\label{chap:outlook}
Moving forward, there are several areas for improvement and further exploration. The issues with the current measurement circuit and the default register configurations need to be addressed in future iterations of the chip. Additionally, more time should be allocated for the design and layout phase to avoid the rush that led to some of the mistakes in this project.

In terms of testing, the test setup could be further refined to allow for more in-depth testing. This would provide more detailed insights into the performance of the chip.

Finally, the project has demonstrated the potential of ASICs in the field of hearing instrument charging. With further development and refinement, these chips could play a crucial role in improving the efficiency and reliability of HI charging cradles.
