This document focuses on the pre-layout phase of a project, which was divided into pre-layout and post-layout stages. The project was initiated by Sonova AG, with the objective of designing a compact 200 mA DC/DC converter for potential integration into the charging case of their hearing devices. This first part of the documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the key steps undertaken during the pre-layout phase, including DC/DC topology selection, circuit architecture/design, and chip interface considerations. By examining these crucial aspects, this documentation offers valuable insights into the initial phase of the project, providing a solid foundation for the subsequent layout and manufacturing, and testing stages.
